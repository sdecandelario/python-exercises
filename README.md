# Python exercises
The main goal on this repository is to put some python exercises.

The code is mostly inspired by [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) and the repository [example-code-2e](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e) from the [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) book.

Each folder is going to be a topic I want to improve or make some exercises to improve my skills and understand better the language.
